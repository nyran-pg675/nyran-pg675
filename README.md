Hi there, Iâ€™m Nyran Abraham Tahija ðŸ‘‹

I am passionate about studying marine ecosystems, with a strong focus on coral reefs. My interests also extend to blue carbon mapping, precision agriculture, water resource management, and air quality. Among these, coral reef research excites me the most, and I am eager to explore advanced tools such as AI, data science, and machine learning to strengthen my work.
