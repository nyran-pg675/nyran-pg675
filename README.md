I am a M.Sc. Environmental Science candidate with a strong foundation in remote sensing and GIS, sustainable agriculture research and mapping, environmental monitoring, and marine spatial analysis. 

My current master’s thesis uses satellite data and spatio-temporal analysis to monitor environmental stress in coral reef ecosystems, focusing on bleaching distribution, intensity, and species vulnerability—bridging marine science and advanced geospatial methods to support conservation and management.
