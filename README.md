As an Environmental Science Postgraduate candidate, I actively apply remote sensing and GIS tools learned during my internship to support diverse environmental projects. My hands-on experience with QGIS, ArcGIS Pro, Google Earth Engine, and geospatial data processing has strengthened my ability to analyze satellite imagery, monitor environmental changes, and contribute to data-driven decision-making. I continue to build practical skills by integrating RS and GIS techniques across research, mapping, and environmental monitoring tasks.
