Hi! I’m Nyran Abraham Tahija — an environmental scientist in training with strong interests in environmental management, compliance, and geospatial analysis. I’m currently in my final semester of my master’s in Environmental Science, where I focus on practical solutions for land, water, and marine resource management.

My current master’s thesis uses satellite data and spatio-temporal analysis to monitor environmental stress in coral reef ecosystems, focusing on bleaching distribution, intensity, and species vulnerability—bridging marine science and advanced geospatial methods to support conservation and management.
