Hi there, It is me Nyran Abraham Tahija ðŸ‘‹
I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Environmental Science in India, with a background in Sustainable Fisheries and Marine Resource Management. My early work with ENB Sea Keepers on coral reef assessments, turtle monitoring, and ecosystem surveys deepened my passion for protecting fragile ecosystems. 
Under the guidance of Dr. Jalpa Jadeja, my dissertation focuses on satellite-based spatio-temporal analysis to monitor Sea Surface Temperatures impact on coral health. Despite the protected status and ecological importance of the coral reef, ongoing research is being conducted to understand the temperature fluctuation specifically on coral reef health.
I like to explore the field of remote sensing in marine science, agriculture, water resource management, and air quality. I am a very curious person, eager to learn about these areas and their role in addressing sustainability goals.
