Hi there, I’m Nyran Abraham Tahija 👋

I am passionate about studying marine ecosystems, with a strong focus on coral reefs. My interests also extend to blue carbon mapping, precision agriculture, water resource management, and air quality. Among these, coral reef research excites me the most, and I am eager to explore advanced tools such as AI, data science, and machine learning to strengthen my work.

Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science in Environmental Science in India, building on my background in Sustainable Fisheries and Marine Resource Management. My early experience with ENB Sea Keepers—working on coral reef assessments, turtle monitoring, and ecosystem surveys—fueled my commitment to protecting fragile ecosystems.

My present research involves using satellite-based spatio-temporal analysis to study the impact of sea surface temperature fluctuations on coral health. Despite their ecological importance and protected status, coral reefs remain vulnerable, making it crucial to continue research on how temperature variability affects reef resilience.
