Hi! I’m Nyran — a Master’s student in Environmental Science passionate about marine ecosystems, remote sensing, GIS, and Web GIS development. I love exploring how digital tools can support conservation, improve environmental monitoring, and connect science with real-world decision-making.

My journey blends field experience and geospatial tech. I’ve volunteered with ENB Sea Keepers and the Green Change Initiative, working on marine conservation, sea turtle monitoring, and coral reef assessments. These experiences shaped my interest in community-driven, data-informed conservation.

On the tech side, I work with remote sensing, GIS programming, cloud platforms, and machine learning for environmental applications. I recently completed a research internship at the Alpine Hub for Sustainable Innovation and Skills (AHSIS), focusing on agricultural remote sensing and applied R&D.

I’m motivated by the idea that environmental challenges need both scientific insight and community collaboration — and I’m excited to keep building tools and knowledge that support sustainable, conflict-sensitive environmental action.
