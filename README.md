Hi! I’m Nyran — a Master’s student in Environmental Science passionate about marine ecosystems, remote sensing, GIS, and Web GIS development. I love exploring how digital tools can support conservation, improve environmental monitoring, and connect science with real-world decision-making.

With climate change on a constant rise and the need to provide a wide scope of sustainable living for the welfare and the livelihood of humanity as a whole, environmental scientists have taken a position of great importance.
